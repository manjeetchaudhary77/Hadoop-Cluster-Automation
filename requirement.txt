There could be a file encoding issue.
I have encountered file type encoding issues when working on files between different operating systems and editors - 
in my case particularly between Linux and Windows systems.
I suggest checking your file's encoding to make sure it is suitable for the target linux environment. 

To demonstrate how file type encoding could be this issue, I copy/pasted your example script into Notepad in Windows 
then copied it to a linux machine and ran it:

root@mkc77:~/windows> sh ./originalfile             
./originalfile: line 2: syntax error near unexpected token `$'{\r''
'/originalfile: line 2: `test() {

In this case, Notepad saved the file with carriage returns and linefeeds, causing the error shown above. 
The \r indicates a carriage return (Linux systems terminate lines with linefeeds \n only).

On the linux machine, you could test this theory by running the following to strip carriage returns from the file, 
if they are present:

cat originalfile | tr -d "\r" > newfile

Then try to run the new file sh ./newfile . If this works, the issue was carriage returns as hidden characters.
